# PersonalProjects
# created by @alphrose

A collection of projects that I decided to do on my own time. Some may be just little things I wanted to do, or some may be larger and more challenging.

**The following information pertains to my programs:**
- The .cs files are usually created in SoloLearn.
- The .java files are usually created in BlueJ.
- The .html and .css files are usually created in Caret.(That is, if I make any, which I might).
- The .vb files are usually created in Microsoft Visual Basic 2010.
